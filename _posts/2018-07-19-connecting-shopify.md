Convictional allows you to connect with Shopify so you can trade with your trading partners. This guide will help you get connected.

## Step One

Connecting Shopify is just like installing any other app in your store.

Go to your Settings and select "Connect Shopify":

## Step Two

We will redirect to your Shopify store and ask for permissions:

## Step Three

Once you accept the permissions we will redirect back and confirm success:

## Complete

Once you have done this, we can access your store to help you sync.
