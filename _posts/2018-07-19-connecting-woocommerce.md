Convictional allows you to connect with WooCommerce so you can trade with your trading partners. This guide will help you get connected.

## Step One

If youâ€™re using WooCommerce, you will need to provide the WooCommerce Consumer Key and the Secret Key so we can connect to your store.

These can be generated in your WooCommerce admin under Settings > API.

Convictional needs Read/Write permissions from your API Account.

Login to your WooCommerce store, go to WooCommerce Settings > Advanced > REST API:

## Step Two

Once you grant Read/Write permissions, you will see some strings:

## Step Three

Then copy/paste the key and secret back into Convictional Settings:

## Complete

Once you have done this, we can access your store to help you sync.
