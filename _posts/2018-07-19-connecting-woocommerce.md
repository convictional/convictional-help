## Introduction

Convictional allows you to connect with WooCommerce so you can trade with your trading partners.

### Step One

If youâ€™re using WooCommerce, you will need to provide the WooCommerce Consumer Key and the Secret Key. These can be easily found (or generated) in your WooCommerce admin under Settings > API. 
Convictional needs Read/Write permissions from you when you create your API Account. Login to your WooCommerce store, go to Advanced > REST API:

### Step Two

Once you grant Read/Write permissions, you will see some strings:

### Step Three

Then copy/paste the key and secret you get back into Convictional:

### Complete

Once you have done this, you will be able to sync with your trading partner on Convictional.
