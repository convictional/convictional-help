This page contains the status of various Convictional services. Most companies offer a status page that tells you whether a service is currently online. This is how the status pages of some of the largest web companies work, but knowing whether a service is "online" rarely tells you if it works.

So we decided to be different, and tell you whether services have the expected behavior (ie. they work). For something like documentation, that just means it is online. But for our sync, admin and API, we'll tell you whether it is working as expected. If something is wrong, we'll include an ETA to resolve it.

## Current Status

| Service | Status  | Description        |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| API     | working | Works as expected. |
| Admin   | working | Works as expected. |
| Sync    | partial | Post products to partners WooCommerce running into API limits. Investigating. ETA: 24-07-2018. Get in touch with support if you observe this. |
| Docs    | working | Works as expected. |
| Help    | working | Works as expected. |
| Blog    | working | Works as expected. |
| Website | working | Works as expected. |
