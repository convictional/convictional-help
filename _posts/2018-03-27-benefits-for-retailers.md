# Introduction

If you’re seeing this, it’s probably because one of your suppliers wants to introduce you to an integration that will make it easier for you to **sell their products** and **grow your business**.

## What It Is

Using Convictional, you can outsource order fulfillment directly to your supplier(s) through automated backend dropshipping that integrates with your ecommerce platform.

## Why It’s Good

It’s simple. Dropshipping means: no inventory to carry & no logistical headaches when it’s time to fulfil an order.

When you get an online order, we’ll automatically transfer its fulfillment information directly to your supplier so that:

They can handle those pesky inventory and shipping logistics for you, and
You can spend more time focusing on growing your business - and keeping those orders coming!

To sum it up: you get an order → your customer receives it (without you ever holding inventory or managing the shipping and fulfillment process - your supplier does it all!)
